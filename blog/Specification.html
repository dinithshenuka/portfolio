    <p>Assessment regulations</p>
    <p>Refer to section 4 of the “How you study” guide for undergraduate students for a clarification of how you are
      assessed, penalties and late submissions, what constitutes plagiarism etc.</p>
    <p>Penalty for Late Submission</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you submit your coursework late but within 24 hours or one working day of the specified deadline, 10 marks
        will
        be deducted from the final mark, as a penalty for late submission, except for work which obtains a mark in the
        range 40 – 49%, in which case the mark will be capped at the pass mark (40%). If you submit your coursework more
        than 24 hours or more than one working day after the specified deadline you will be given a mark of zero for the
        work in question unless a claim of Mitigating Circumstances has been submitted and accepted as valid.</li>
      <li>is recognised that on occasion, illness or a personal crisis can mean that you fail to submit a piece of work
        on
        time. In such cases you must inform the Campus Office in writing on a mitigating circumstances form, giving the
        reason for your late or non-submission. You must provide relevant documentary evidence with the form. This
        information will be reported to the relevant Assessment Board that will decide whether the mark of zero shall
        stand. For more detailed information regarding University Assessment Regulations, please refer to the following

    <ul>
      <li>A Main Page with a suitable HTML5 structure containing side information (either a twitter feed, or links to
        social media accounts (yours or any other relevant one(s))</li>

        attribute.
      </li>
      <li>A Page with a Form for people to register to your newsletter and/or send you a message. Ensure that your page
        makes use of appropriate HTML5 form elements, and has an appropriate page structure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All pages must be written in HTML5. You must ensure that HTML5 is used correctly and efficiently to ensure
      correct
      semantic and validation where appropriate. Ensure that your code makes use good comments and indentation.</p><br><br>
    <p>B. Create a single external style sheet file, written in CSS3, to style the whole site. </p>
    <p>You are required to use the following:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Specify font(s) to be used throughout the site and in more specific areas, using either @font-face or google
        fonts</li>
      <li>Colours (including at least one semi-transparent),</li>
      <li>Shadows</li>
      <li>Text effects</li>
      <li>Attribute selectors (minimum 2)</li>
      <li>Pseudo elements with generated content in at least one place on your site</li>
      <li>User action pseudo class</li>
      <li>Child combinator</li>
      <li>Structural selectors</li>
      <li>Negation pseudo class</li>
      <li>Nth pseudo class</li>
      <li>Validity pseudo class</li>
      <li>Relational selector</li>
      <li>Border</li>
      <li>Rounded corners (can be of size 0 if you do not wish to have rounded corners)</li>

    </ol><br><br>
    <p>C. Make your Portfolio responsive so it would display well on a small screen using media queries.</p><br><br>
    <p>D. Strongly recommended but not required: Take notes as you go along, and build a diary to cover the progress
      that
      you make each week, illustrated with screenshots or drawings of progress of the design and its implementation.
      This
      should include your initial low fidelity drawings for your pages structure and layout for large screen and mobile
      view. This can be pictures of hand-drawn designs and the mapping of sections to HTML5 Elements. This will help you
      with the in-class test.</p>
    <p>You should write as a minimum one full summary entry covering all progress since the last entry once every 2
      weeks,
      although ideally you could write one each week. These will cover progress with design/layout, content, your
      choices
      of layout, fonts, colours, and selectors for section B. Make sure to include the date of each entry. </p><br><br>
    <p>E. Combine a final word document with your final website screenshots and code. This will need to contain as a
      minimum: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>html files (A),</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>your css file (B &amp; C),</li>
      <li>your diary (D)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will need to print this document and bring it for the test, as the test will ask you to made annotations on
      this document and some of your diary entries may also directly cover some of the test questions.</p>
    <p>Prepare a zip file with the above Document E and your HTML files (plus all related resources needed e.g. images,
      fonts etc), CSS file, Diary</p><br><br>
